# Exercise 2: working with `dplyr`
# Note that this exercise repeats the analysis from Exercise 1, but should be 
# performed using `dplyr` (do not directly access or manipulate the data frames)

# Install and load the "fueleconomy" package
#install.packages("devtools")
#devtools::install_github("hadley/fueleconomy")
library(fueleconomy)

# Install and load the "dplyr" library
install.packages("dplyr")

# Select the different manufacturers (makes) of the cars in this data set. 
# Save this vector in a variable
makes <- select(vehicles, make)

# Use the `distinct()` function to determine how many different car manufacturers
# are represented by the data set
nrow(distinct(makes))

# Filter the data set for vehicles manufactured in 1997
manufactured_1997 <- filter(vehicles, year == 1997)

# Arrange the 1997 cars by highway (`hwy`) gas milage
manufactured_1997 <- arrange(manufactured_1997, hwy)

# Mutate the 1997 cars data frame to add a column `average` that has the average
# gas milage (between city and highway mpg) for each car
manufactured_1997 <- mutate(manufactured_1997, average = (cty + hwy) / 2)

# Filter the whole vehicles data set for 2-Wheel Drive vehicles that get more
# than 20 miles/gallon in the city. 
# Save this new data frame in a variable.
two_wheel_20_mpg <- filter(vehicles, drive == "2-Wheel Drive" & cty > 20)

# Of the above vehicles, what is the vehicle ID of the vehicle with the worst 
# hwy mpg?
# Hint: filter for the worst vehicle, then select its ID.
filtered <- filter(two_wheel_20_mpg, hwy == min(hwy))
selected <- select(filtered, id)

# Write a function that takes a `year_choice` and a `make_choice` as parameters,
# and returns the vehicle model that gets the most hwy miles/gallon of vehicles 
# of that make in that year.
# You'll need to filter more (and do some selecting)!
make_year_filter <- function(make_choice, year_choice) {
  filtered <- filter(vehicles, make == make_choice, year == year_choice)
  filtered <- filter(filtered, hwy == max(hwy))
